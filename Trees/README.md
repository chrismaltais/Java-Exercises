# Tree Problems

## Why use a Tree?
- Efficient at Insertion and Deletion, and Retriving
- Flexible, can move subtrees around with minimum effort

## Traversals
### Depth First Traversal (DFS)
#### PreOrder Traversal
(Root, Left, Right)
(Algorithm to come)
#### InOrder Traversal
(Left, Root, Right)
(Algorithm to come)
#### PostOrder Traversal
(Left, Right, Root)
(Algorithm to come)

### Breadth First Traversal (BFS)
#### LevelOrder Traversal
Left to Right from Top to Bottom

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
